We're stoked to announce that Forestry.io is going to be part of [Techstars NYC](http://www.techstars.com/startup-accelerator/).  The 90-day program runs from July until the end of September 2016.  

What this means for Forestry and our users:

* We're going to be surrounded by some of the brightest minds in New York tech
